prz_souvenir_plot_defense: "Souvenir Plot Defense"
	prz_souvenir_plot_defense_desc: "We have sold tiny plots in a ring around the city walls, making each owner a technical noble of Prague. Since anyone from any nation can purchase these plots of land, we have, in effect, created a second wall made of paperwork around our fair city, creating a political and administrative nightmare for any would-be attacker who need trespass."
prz_wide_as_the_sea: "Wide as the sea"
  prz_wide_as_the_sea_desc: "Many of the nobles that come to tour their newly purchased land in our fair city never leave. This has resulted in hundreds of 'qualifying' candidates looking to make a name for themselves each election cycle, campaigning in every street, business, and alleyway."

prz_government_friendly_suggestions: "Friendly Suggestions"
  prz_government_friendly_suggestions_desc: "In our fair city, it is not uncommon to see dozens of would-be mayoral candidates debating policy in the same tavern on any given night. With such an open discussion on city policy, we've found ways to cut corners in just the right way to stretch ourselves further than most governments."
	
prz_cities_on_the_walls: "Cities on the Walls"
  prz_cities_on_the_walls_desc: "With our unusual practice of selling lands around our cities, it has forced our development to sprawl tall rather than wide. This upward growth has expanded onto the walls themselves. With our wall patrols and garrison now taking place in the city proper, we kill two birds with one stone. Protecting the populace and demonstrating our capabilities to patrol such a developing labyrinth."
	
prz_noble_intentions: "Noble Intentions"
  prz_noble_intentions_desc: "With the Empire distracted with the violent rise of the Reformation and the ever-present threat of Hellenism. Now would be the perfect time to demonstrate that any man can build his castle in Prague for the right price."

prz_merchant_wagons_of_war: "Wagons of War" 
  prz_merchant_wagons_of_war_desc: "We've discovered that while our enemies may be able to hit the broadside of a barn, there is little they can do if that barn has a sheet of metal and wheels attached to it. This has allowed our riflemen to shoot from near point-blank distances with little repercussion."
	
prz_pous: "Rights of Unusual Standings" 
  prz_pous_desc: "Although much of our populace would not consider their origins to be from Prague. With every man able to plant the flag of their ancestors at our city foundation, we have torn walls down like no other known nation."

san_sink_or_swim: "Sink or Swim"
  san_sink_or_swim_desc: "The story of our exile is a tragedy, a lesson on the perils of close-minded fools cliung to dogma. We have taken this to heart. Our new refuge is one where all may speak their minds. In this swirling maelstrom, the best ideas will survive where all others sink to the depths of obscurity."
san_shipwrecked_shipwrights: "Shipwrecked Shipwrights"
  san_shipwrecked_shipwrights_desc: "We came to these shores with little more that what we could fit in the vessals that carried us through sea and storm. With limited resources we became expert of improvision. The shipyards of old may lie beyond the horizon, but this new world has reources aplenty. We shall sail forever!"
san_council_of_captains: "Council of Captains"
  san_council_of_captains_desc: "The old world was on of kings and lords. Tyrants all! Just as each ship is led by a captain chosen from amongst its crew so must be the ship of state. The Lord Admiral chosen from amongsth these captains shall represent us all. Under their guidance doe we sail towards new horizons and brighter shores."
san_come_hell_or_high_water: "Come Hell or High Water"
  san_come_hell_or_high_water_desc: "All our history, we have been set upon, opressed, and pushed west. Be it by Romans, by Vikings, by our own people. No more! Here we make our home. Let them come. We have mastered this new battlefield, the sea shall be our ally allowing us to land and slip away. Our wrath moves with the tides. Let our enemies be dashed upon the rocks!"
san_gateway_to_the_world: "Gateway to the World"
  san_gateway_to_the_world_desc: "As the world grows ever more interconnected, commerce thribes and profits grow. Santuario's ports provide excellent places for merchants to resupply and repair.

  san_here_be_dragons_desc: "With the advancement of anval warfare and the continued construction of more ships, the need for cannong grew at an uprecedented pace. In order to mee demand, Santuario put great effort into not only the construction and expansion of foundries but the design of cannon for their unique needs as well.

The Caribbean became reknown for both the safety of its shipping lands and Santuario's tight grip upon its commerce"

UNI_ideas_bonus: "University Ambitions"

uni_introduction_to_applied_wizardry: "Introduction to Applied Wizardry"
 uni_introduction_to_applied_wizardry_desc: "Most go through life focused entirely on the now. Peasants seek to sustain themselves, lords seek to keep and gain power, and the clergy seek to maintain the faith. It is our responsibility, as wizards, to see beyond the present. We study the mysteries of this world, the problems of the pasts and the possibility of tyhe future, in order to chart a course for the betteer. Our knowledge is the engine of progress; let it guide us, and society, to a new golden age"
uni_imperial_translators: "Imperial Advisors"
 uni_imperial_translators_desc: "As long as there have been rulers, there have been those standing behind them offering council. We are the inheritors of this legacy. When lords busy themselves with schemeing, feasting, and swordplay, they have no time for study. As such, in matters academic, all courts seek a wizard. In the Empire, none are more sought after than those of the University, our presence prestigious to those whom employ us, our wisdom indispensible. This status allows University enboys to move thoughout Imperial Courts, a reputation bolstering influence where words alone do not suffice"
uni_academic_privilege: "Academic Privilege"
 uni_academic_privilege_desc: "Those who question the order of things have always risked persecution for speaking out. Questioning is, however, the core of learning and there must be a place for it in the University. While the most egrregious rabble-rousers need not be tolerated, those who seek honest inquiry shall never be punished for uncovering truith, not within these hallowed halls."
uni_phials_and_flasks: "Phials and Flasks"
  uni_phials_and_flasks_desc: "Alchemist are a stange bunch. There are few who can stomach spending their days in the dark and damp, breathing in vaporrs of gods' know what while burns and fumes slowly drive them mad. These outcast were once driven to the edges of society, but with the freedom to experiment and a steady supply of grant money the College Alchemic has flourished. While the products of their labor may be dangerous to make (and are liable to explode), that makes them quite proficatble. In addition, many of the stange elixirs and portions have benefits to one's health in addition to the sheer amount of soap needed to clean up the constant spills."
uni_modern_major_generals: "Modern Major Generals"
  uni_modern_major_generals_desc: "In the past, military knowledgte was a taboo amongst wizards. Tactics and swordplay were the domain of princes and kings, who hoped to win lands and title. More often they ended up as corpses in a ditch. If there is one thing the wizards are able to do however, it is learn, and the War of Scholars taught many hard lessons. Reliance on fickle nobvles to fight wars presented a danger that nearly saw them burned at the stake. \n Such was formed the Gelehrterwache, trained soldiers sworn to the University's service. If men-at-arms were going to represent the wizards, ti wouldn't do to have them be any old brutes with sticks. Heidelberg Military Academy was founded, giving promising soldiers an education both in warcraft and general knowledge, no matter their origin. Expanding the pool of well-trained officers led too a higher quality army, and generals whom the wizards were not shamed to interact with."
uni_unity_of_the_colleges: "Unity of the Colleges"
  uni_unity_of_the_colleges_desc: "It is a well known truth that if you put two scholars in a  room they will find something to debate about. Many jokes are made about the University being a bunch of ever bickering academics. It is a useful lie. Its citizens, be they wizards or not, are very aware of the rights and benefits they possess and when threatened will swiftly close ranks. Many are the spies who hoped to bribe a vocal critic or dissident into undermining the nation, only to have an unexpected and long lasting stay in the dungeons. Seldfom is the University more dangerous that when ane exterior threat unites them against a common foe."
uni_explosive_results: "Explosive Results"
  uni_explosive_results_desc: "Any good scholar knows there is always something to b elearned form failure, and, if the constant booming coming from the College Alchemic is anything to by, the wizards have much to learn from. Black powder may have originated in Asia, the University's chemical experitise led to its quick adoption. Years of refining and innovation have led them to be its greatest producer on the continent and creators and the high quality explosives known to man"
