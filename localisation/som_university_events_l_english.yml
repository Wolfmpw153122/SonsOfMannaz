university_events.1.t:0 "The War of Scholars"
university_events.1.d:0 " Centuries ago the University was founded by the wizards who advised Imperial rulers. It was a secretive organization, but it was tolerated for the advice its members gave was sound and it opened doors to several diplomatic backchannels usefful to a monarch who had occasional need for secrecy. Its influence was often limited by distrust and by the clergy who disliked the constant inccesent questioning and disruptions to the balance of powers.\n That all changed when the young duke of Baden invited the Universirtty to establish a permanent campus in Heidelberg. With his duchy long on the edges of Imperial politics and surrounded by larger neighbors, he hoped encouraging a sense of loyalty from the academics could turn his fortune's around.\n It worked.\n To a degree\n Heidelberg flourished as wizards came and went on strange business and clandestine diplomacy, bringing money and pretige. Baden was growing increasingly relevant on the Imperial stage and the scholars appreciated a more stable home.\n Then the duke's son grew ill. In an attempt to regain influence the clergy advised against the University's \"Unnatural\" remedies. The promised that trust and faith in the gods would put things right. \n It did not.\n The duke grew depressed and withdrew from his duties. More and more tasks fell to his advisors. Suddenly the duchy no longer felt governed from the capital in Baden but from the wizards seat in Heidelberg and the church's stronghold in Konstanz. Couriers moved day and night as both scholars pushed for influence, all the while the nation's leader fell deeper and deeper into his sorrow.\n Then the duke fell ill\n It was the same sickness that struck hgis son and this time he called the wizards for aid. Their minstrations worked. Briefly. Their diagnosis gave him a year. An heirless duke with one year to live. The power stuggle had already begun. The University pushed for influence with the nobility. The clergy whispered to the people that wizards were poisoning their leaders mind. Suppliers were stockpiled and alliances forged in secret. The country prepared for a fight. Then time ran out./n 15 months after the wizards' diagnosis, death visited the palace once more. The tension held, neither side wanted to be the agressor. Both shared power as a council and tried to chart a path forward. Then an inquistor executed a wizard in Heidelberg for blasphemy. He was quickly arredted. In an effort to avoid war, they kept him prisoner until rioting in the city forced their hand. The convict was hanged. Konstanz marshalled its forces and seized the fort at Urach. The University countered and occupied Durlach. Baden was split in two, the War of Scholars had begun."

university_events.2.t:0 "Picking Up the Pieces"
university_events.2.d:0 " The traitors have been routed, the University's flag flies aboce Konstanz. We have won!\n And yet it does not feel like victory. Baden is devastated, thousands lie dead, and power-hungry eyes from across the Empire turn toward us. Our position stands upon a knife's edge. What remains of our industry lies firmly in the grip of merchant barons to who we are severly in debt, the nobles who sided with us to break the church's control now envision themselves on the nation's empty throne, and what remains of the claric's posionous sermos threaten to turn the populace against us. Meanwhile, we lose time and resources as we debate endlessly amongst ourselves on the best way to proceed. Action must be taken. If we do not begin to stabilize the country, all we have gained wil be lost adn the late duke's legacy will be goround into the dust with us."
